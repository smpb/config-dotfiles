# Dot Files

This repository includes my personal "dot" configuration files for several key tools.

## Requirements

By default, this is a macOS-centric setup but affordances have been made for it to be universal across any Linux environment.

Regardless, these are the expectations:

- All the tools referenced have been externally installed.
- `zsh` is the default shell.

## Setup

Once cloned, running the bootstrap script should be enough:

    ./bin/bootstrap.sh
